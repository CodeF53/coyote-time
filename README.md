# Coyote Time

This mod is a Fabric port of the port exclusive feature of the Forge port of the Fabric mod "Second Chance" (Original fabric mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/second-chance) (Forge port: https://modrinth.com/mod/second-chance-forge)

Features:

- You can jump once within 10 ticks after walking/running off a block
- Removes the jump cooldown
- You can jump while standing in water (this was apparently a bug that was fixed in the original version, but i liked it so i brought it back)

No configs for now, sorry.

The main branch is called `1.18` currently, but the jar works on 1.19 too.
